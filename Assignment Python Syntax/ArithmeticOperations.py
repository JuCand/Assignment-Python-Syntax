# Task 1: Grocery Store Math Calculate the total cost of three items you'd commonly find in a grocery store, given their individual prices. 
# For example, what would be the cost of bread, peanut butter, and jelly be? Prices don't need to be realistic!

bread = 2.20 
peaunt_butter = 4.15
jelly = 3.24

print(bread + peaunt_butter + jelly)


# Task 2: Bank Interest If you have a savings account with a particular initial amount and a fixed yearly interest rate, calculate the total amount in your account after a year. 
# So if you had $10,000 at a 7% interest write code that would tell us the amount at the end of the year. For the example the expected outcome would be $10,700.

bank_balance = 10000
interest = .07
balance_after_one_year = bank_balance * interest + bank_balance

print(balance_after_one_year)
